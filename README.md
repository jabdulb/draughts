# Draughts
This program is created for me CE301 assignment at the University of Essex.
A lot of the code is inspired by Dipansh Khandewal's Android Chess game, which can be found here: https://github.com/DipanshKhandelwal/Chess

Images of draught pieces are thanks to Joe Esposito's own checker's game, which can be found here: https://github.com/joeyespo/checkers

This game is not expected to be completed until May 2019.
